title: Specifying and verifying concurrent programs using the K framework
subtitle: current status and open problems
author: Traian Florin Șerbănuță
institute: Runtime Verification
abstract: The first part of this presentation will show (through toy examples) that K seems like an ideal framework to describe concurrency and memory models. The second part will present the current status of verifying concurrent programs in K, identify limitations, and discuss possible ways of addressing them.|

# What is K?

# A semantics-based interpreter

## An executable formal semantics of C with applications

- Presented at POPL'12 [@c-def]

- The (positive) semantics of the C language


## Defining the undefinedness of C

- Presented at PLDI'15 [@c-undef-2]
  - based on earlier work [by @c-undef-1]

- The (negative) semantics of the C language

## Other research surrounding the C semantics

- Test-case reduction for C compiler bugs [@c-testing]

- All the above [@c-ellison]
