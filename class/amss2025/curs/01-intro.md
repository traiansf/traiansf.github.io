# Who We Are

- Name
- Program / year
- One fun fact about you
- Your experience with software / modeling

::: notes
Encourage students to share to build rapport. Keep it short and light-hearted.

# Course Scope & Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to get better at:

- Analyzing requirements of software systems
- Creating structural and behavioral UML models
- Applying (some) design patterns effectively
- Evaluating models for consistency and completeness

::: notes
Highlight the importance of these objectives in professional practice.
:::

---

# Course Structure

- **Structural diagrams**: class, package, component, deployment
- **Behavioral diagrams**: use case, state, activity, interaction
- **Model evaluation & testing**
- **Documentation & design patterns**
- **Project**

::: notes
Walk through the modules in sequence. Connect them to real-world examples.
:::

---

# Assessments

- Project: 100%
  - teams consisting of 4-5 students (recommended)
  - there will be a single note for the entire team
  - documentation (50%) and presentation (50%)
- Participation: 10% bonus

::: notes
Adapt percentages based on actual syllabus. Emphasize the importance of the project and teamwork.
:::

# Why Analysis & Modeling?

- Software projects fail due to poor communication and unclear requirements
- Models help us:
  - Visualize systems
  - Detect errors early
  - Improve maintainability
  - Communicate across teams

::: notes
Give a real-life anecdote about a failed project due to lack of clear modeling.

# Icebreaker: Model Your Morning Routine

**Task:** Draw a simple diagram of how you got from waking up to arriving in class.

- 5 minutes individual work
- Share with a neighbor
- Volunteers present their models

::: notes
Encourage creativity—stick figures, flowcharts, boxes & arrows. The goal is to get comfortable with abstraction.
:::

---

# Mini Modeling Challenge

**Scenario:** A university library system.

- Users: students, faculty, external
- Operations: borrow, return, renew, reserve
- Constraints: borrowing limits

**Task:** Sketch a simple class diagram and at least one use case.

::: notes
Give students ~15 minutes in small groups. Circulate and answer questions.
:::

---

# Discussion

- Compare different group solutions
- What entities and relationships emerged?
- What use cases are most critical?
- What was challenging?

::: notes
Facilitate sharing. Emphasize there are multiple valid perspectives.
